        <p>The words <mark>nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans</mark>. The word comes from the Latin natura meaning "birth". Nature includes many things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies. Scientists study the way the parts of nature work. Things that have been made by people are said to be man-made or called artifacts.

            There are natural sciences that study different parts of nature, for example the science of ecology is about plants and animals as a whole, while biology studies every type of living thing.
            
            From one point of view, humans are a prime example of nature, and are the most widely studied natural inhabitants of the planet earth. Humans interact with each other in their natural environment on a day-to-day basis. Every part of nature – everything from the air outside to the dirt on the ground – is interdependent. Medicine studies humans in health and sickness.</p>
            <p>From another point of view, humans and nature can be said to be in conflict. People always use natural resources. <mark> cut down trees, mine ores, grow crops and manufacture things from natural material.</mark> Fires, cars, and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places. People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. In the modern world, with many more people and many big cities, these problems are becoming more serious.

                Nature, in the broadest sense, means the physical world as a whole.<mark> This is the meaning that physics, the study of nature (etymologically), takes.</mark></p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center; color: darkblue;"> TYPES OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION</h1>

            water pollution
        </h2>
        <p><mark>Water pollution (or aquatic pollution)</mark> is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities, so that it negatively affects its uses.[1]: 6  Water bodies include <b>lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater.</b> Water pollution results when contaminants mix with these water bodies. Contaminants can come from <b>one of four main sources: sewage discharges, industrial activities, agricultural activities, and urban runoff including stormwater.</b>[2] Water pollution is either surface water pollution or groundwater pollution. This form of pollution can lead to many problems, such as the degradation of aquatic ecosystems or spreading water-borne diseases when people use polluted water for drinking or irrigation.[3] Another problem is that water pollution reduces the ecosystem services (such as providing drinking water) that the water resource would otherwise provide.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">air pollution</h2>
        <p><mark>AIR pollution </mark> the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.[1] It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere.[2] There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases<b> (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane, carbon dioxide[fact or opinion</b>(See discussion.)] and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain).[3] Air pollution can be caused by both human activities[4] and natural phenomena.[5]</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;color: brown;">soil pollution</h2>
        <p><mark>Soil Pollution</mark> has gradually become a <b>major challenge that we need to overcome for establishing a healthy environment.</b> Weathering of the earth’s crusts by different processes leads to the formation of soil that accumulates over the centuries. The soil is the home for a large part of bacterial biodiversity and other microscopic and macroscopic living organisms.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center ;">sound pollution</h2>
        <p><mark>Environmental noise </mark> an accumulation of noise pollution that occurs outside. This noise can be caused by transport, industrial, and recreational activities.[1]

            Noise is frequently described as<b> 'unwanted sound'</b>. Within this context, environmental noise is generally present in some form in all areas of human, animal, or environmental activity. The effects in humans of exposure to environmental noise may vary from emotional to physiological and psychological.[2] Noise at low levels is not necessarily harmful. Environmental noise can also convey a sense of liveliness in an area, which can be desirable. The adverse effects of noise exposure (i.e. noise pollution) could include: interference with speech or other 'desired' sounds, annoyance, sleep disturbance, anxiety, hearing damage and stress-related cardiovascular health problems.[3]
            
            As a result,<b> environmental noise is studied, regulated, and monitored by many governments and institutions around the world.</b> This creates a number of different occupations. The basis of all decisions is supported by the objective and accurate measurement of noise. Noise is measured in decibels (dB) using a pattern-approved sound level meter.</p>
